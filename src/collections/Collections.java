    // Collection:          is any data structure that can hold zero or more data items. Generally, the data
    //                      items will be of the same type or, in languages supporting inheritance, derived from
    //                      some common ancestor type. Collections can utilize certain data structures, such as
    //                      Hash Tables and Balanced Binary Trees, to improve their memory and performance
    //                      characteristics.

    // Data Structure:      is any structure that holds data. Data Structures are distinguished from each other
    //                      by their memory usage and performance characteristics. For example, the lookup
    //                      performance of a Hash Table is O(1), while that of a balanced binary tree is O(log n).


    // Types of datastructures:
    // [1] Linear           ->  Arranged in sequence, one after another
    // [2] Non-Linear       ->  Not in any sequence, connected to 1 or more elements

        //      [4] Deque

        //      [1] ArrayList
        //      [2] Vector
